Hi! Thanks for reading this README!

To run this program PLEASE just run the file in the command line as "ipython PHYS239_HW3.py"
or run the file in your favorite compiler.

There is no need to call functions directly! I have made an interactive GUI to be your guide.
Upon running the file a small pop up should appear with a menu.
It SHOULD be raised in front of all other windows but sometimes it gets buried.
If it doesn't appear, look in your taskbar and it should be there, probably named TKinter.

If you NEED the functions related to the HW assignment, they are the first few functions at the top of the file.

I'd recommend you not try to delve too deep into the other functions that handle the GUI... it's a mess.

This program uses a non-standard package : "scipy"
Please install if (if you don't already) before you run this.

Ignore the user warnings that the program spits out about creating a legend with loc=best.

This program is pretty slow because of the amount of calculations its doing when the calculate button is pressed.
Please be patient... it usually only takes ~10-20 seconds. 
Tkinter will throw a fit and say its not responding but just wait and it'll come back.
