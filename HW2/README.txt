Hi! Thanks for reading this README!

To run this program PLEASE just run the file in the command line as "ipython PHYS239_HW2.py"
or run the file in your favorite compiler.

There is no need to call functions directly! I have made an interactive GUI to be your guide.
Upon running the file a small pop up should appear with a menu.
It SHOULD be raised in front of all other windows but sometimes it gets buried.
If it doesn't appear, look in your taskbar and it should be there, probably named TKinter.

If you NEED the functions related to the HW assignment, they are the first few functions at the top of the file.

I'd recommend you not try to delve too deep into the other functions that handle the GUI... it's a mess.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program only uses standard python packages, you shouldn't have to install anything to run it.

The first few problems are pretty straight forward in their purpose.

---> In Problem  4 , the button parameters correspond to their parameters listed in the HW pdf.




Everything worked on my computer... but TKinter is fickle, please email me if something is throwing errors!

Thanks!
